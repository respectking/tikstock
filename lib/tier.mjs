   Who can see what.

   Three steps, deliberately. A visitor gets enough companies to understand
   what the thing is. Signing in costs them an email and buys a much bigger
   allowance, which is where most people stop and where the mailing list comes
   from. Paying removes the count entirely.

     signed out    5 companies
     free account  20 companies
     member        all of them, plus the things below

   The count is of distinct companies looked at, not swipes, so flicking back
   and forth over the same five does not burn the allowance.

   IMPORTANT, and the reason this file is only half the job: enforcing this in
   the browser stops nobody who can open developer tools, and data/snapshot.json
   is a public URL. This layer decides what the interface offers. It is not a
   security boundary and must not be mistaken for one. The boundary is the
   server, and building it is a separate piece of work — see PAYWALL.md.
